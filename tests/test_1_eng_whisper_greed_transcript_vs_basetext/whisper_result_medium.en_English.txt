Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

And I'm Dan.

My husband, who is also going to be giving another perspective in today's conversation.

Today we're bringing you an amazing long English conversation.

So prepare your ears, prepare your mind.

We're going to be talking about 12 different topics and hopefully providing some new expressions,

new ways to think about life.

I don't know about that, but at least some English help for you.

It's going to get personal today, so get ready.

Vanessa, yes.

All right.

Are you ready to get started?

Dan I'm ready.

Vanessa Let's go.

Our first topic is family.

And my question is, who do you think that you're the most like?

Dan Whom I the most like?

In appearance?

Vanessa Yes.

Dan Both, both appearance and character?

Vanessa Yeah, both.

Dan Okay.

So appearance, I look mostly like my mom, I think.

Vanessa Okay.

Dan I have more of her skin tone.

I have her eyes.

And on her side of the family, most of the people are pretty skinny.

And I'm a rather skinny guy.

My dad's side is German and they tend to be a little bit bigger.

So yeah, I definitely got my mom's side.

But character wise, I think I'm a little more like my dad.

Would you agree?

Vanessa Yeah, I'd say you have shades of your dad.

Dan You know me so well, so you can answer this

too.

Vanessa I think you have shades of your dad.

Dan Shades.

Yeah.

I think I'm more silly than my dad.

That's not very hard because my dad is pretty serious.

Vanessa He's got a silly side though.

Dan He does, yeah.

But for the most part, I think I'm more like my dad because he has a very calm demeanor.

He's very patient and he doesn't get stressed about anything.

And actually, my dad gets so unstressed about everything, I can't even understand it.

I'm like, how are you so calm right now?

But everybody I know thinks that I'm the most stress-free person they know.

Vanessa But your dad is even more stress-free.

Dan Yeah.

But we're similar growing up when my parents would be going somewhere and needing to get

out of the house.

Me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time.

And we'd be like, what?

We'll make it.

We'll be okay.

No problem.

Vanessa And your mom and brother and sister were saying,

come on.

Hi.

Dan And my mom is like, God, let's go.

My mom is much more high stress, anxious kind of personality.

Vanessa That's kind of a typical family situation,

I think.

Dan How about you?

Vanessa I think I have both my parents in me as well.

I think I look a lot like my mom.

Dan Yeah.

She looks exactly like her mom.

They're like, to a T. Vanessa Sometimes when I see pictures of myself

and then I look at a picture of her at the same age, I think, whoa.

We look really similar and she looks a lot like her mom.

So I can kind of imagine what I'll look like when I'm getting older.

Dan Yeah.

I mean, you have darker hair and darker features.

You got that from your dad.

Vanessa Yeah, somewhat.

But I think a lot of my features are similar to my mom.

But I think I also got my facial expressions from my mom.

A lot of you comment that, wow, Vanessa, you have a lot of expressions.

Dan Your mom is very expressive, just like you.

Vanessa And I think it's true that I use a lot of

expressions, but it's just natural for me.

I do this in daily life as I'm talking about things.

And I think that I get that from my mom.

Sometimes I see some of her expressions and I realize, oh, I do that too.

Dan Yeah.

I remember when we lived in South Korea, every single Korean person was commenting on Vanessa's

expressions.

They're like, your face, it's so exciting.

How are you making so many faces?

Everybody was surprised.

Vanessa I don't know.

Dan I guess in Korea they don't make as many faces.

Vanessa I don't know.

Maybe it's just not.

It's just an unusual trait.

I'm grateful for that.

Especially as a teacher, I can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my

face as well.

But I feel like I also have parts of my dad.

My dad is a pretty rational guy.

Dan You're rational like your dad.

Vanessa Yeah.

But I think I also have his sense of humor.

Sometimes a little strange sense of humor, but we laugh at the same things.

We enjoy playing games and being competitive.

So I think that that side of me, maybe some of the character side of me is similar to

him.

But I feel like I also have parts of my grandma.

My grandma is a go, go, go, go person.

Dan Oh, that's true.

Yeah.

Vanessa She never stops.

And I think my biggest flaw is that I have difficulty slowing down and relaxing.

I just keep going and I think that- Dan That's why she's with me.

Vanessa I need help relaxing.

Dan To help and relax.

Vanessa Yeah.

I think that my grandma is like this too, that she's always going and always doing things

and it's healthy to slow down every now and then.

And so I need to do that.

She probably needs to do that too sometimes.

But I don't know if I learned that from her, but maybe that's just part of my-

Dan I think it's your personality.

Vanessa DNA of my character.

Dan Yeah.

I can remember even when I first met Vanessa, she was more go, go, go than she is now.

Vanessa Oh, you think so?

Dan Yeah.

More like this thing to the next and like the enthusiasm is always just like bouncing

everything.

Vanessa I always have a lot of enthusiasm.

That's true.

Dan Yes.

It was off the charts.

Vanessa Yeah.

So I want to know for you, who are you most like in your family?

Is it maybe your physical traits or for your character?

All right, let's go on to our second question.

The next topic is childhood.

I want to know when do you think childhood ends and when do you become an adult?

Dan When does childhood end?

Vanessa This is a deep question.

Dan Well, I don't think it can be a specific age.

I think it's different for everyone.

I think it's at any point you can leave the house of your parents and live on your own,

take care of yourself and you're not like dependent on somebody else.

Like if you're living with your friends and bumming off them, you're probably not an adult

yet.

So if I had to pick like an age, I'd probably say like 16.

Vanessa Oh.

Dan Yeah.

I'm saying kind of young.

In an ideal world, I think a 16 year old should be ready.

Vanessa Okay.

Okay.

At 16, were you ready?

Dan No.

Of course not.

Vanessa Ideally.

Dan Ideally.

Yeah.

I don't think our society prepares us to be ready at 16.

It prepares you to be ready at 18.

Vanessa Or later.

Dan Right.

Or later.

So, but in an ideal world, I think you could be ready at 16, but it's a kind of complicated

world now.

So maybe 18 is an acceptable age.

Vanessa I feel like for me, I have less ideas about childhood ending and adulthood starting

that are physical.

I feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions.

There might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home or you have to be dependent

on someone else.

But if you are making your own decisions, you are not a child.

You are an adult.

And I'm sure as our children get older and become teenagers, that's going to be a little

bit harder for us to make that line for someone else.

But I know for myself, making more decisions.

Dan Assuming you are capable as a person to live

on your own, of course.

Vanessa Yeah.

I think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions, but we still need help

from other people as adults.

So there's a, it's a gray area.

Dan Sure.

Vanessa Yeah.

It's not so clear.

Dan I would also add, I don't know, for myself

personally, having children really makes you an adult.

It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but I think it's easier for some people to just

kind of be really selfish and do their own thing and kind of live like a kid, especially

nowadays because we have so much entertainment.

You could just watch TV every day.

A lot of guys I know play video games a lot and not knocking on video games, but playing

video games every day is a good way to remain a child at heart anyways.

This is my opinion.

It's a little judgmental.

Vanessa Yeah.

If you're a good person and you have a child, then you feel forced to become an adult.

There's still bad people who have kids who remain children themselves and then they're

bad parents.

But I think if you're generally a good person when you have kids, that's kind of a shock.

Like, whoa, this child is so dependent on me.

I need to be responsible.

I have to organize myself somehow and you have to change.

Dan Well, I think being an adult, part of it is

having a burden of responsibility of some kind, so whether it's a job or your house

payments or whatever it is.

So some people add those burdens of responsibility anyways without children, but I don't know.

For me, it's just different to like, this is the person I'm taking care of in my life.

People now.

Vanessa Yeah.

Dan If we got two.

Vanessa We got two coming up soon.

So I have a question for you.

When do you think childhood ends?

When does adulthood start?

It's going to be different for every culture too because this is a pretty cultural specific

question.

Maybe in the US it's different than your country.

Dan Maybe you have a rite of passage in your country.

Vanessa Oh, can you explain what a rite of passage

is?

Because that's kind of a nuanced thing.

Dan Yeah.

A rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult.

Vanessa Oh, like some ceremony or activity.

Dan Yeah, like a ceremony.

Yeah.

I mean, we don't really have this in the US.

Some people say college is a rite of passage, but not... I mean, more and more, almost

everybody goes to college now.

Vanessa A lot of people do.

Dan Yeah.

So it kind of is, but it's a really bad one because usually people just go and they have

parties and they live really irresponsibly.

Vanessa It's not a way to become a responsible adult.

Dan Yeah.

And then you do more school.

Vanessa Oh, yeah.

Dan It's not really becoming a man.

Vanessa Changing your life completely.

Yeah.

So I'm curious, in your country, is there something that signifies now you are an adult?

This kind of rite of passage ceremony or festivity or...
