Hi, I'm Vanessa from Speak English by Vanessa dot com.

Damn, Damn my husband, who is also going to be giving another perspective in today's conversation.

Today we're bringing you an amazing long English conversation to prepare your ears, prepare your mind.

We're going to be talking about twelve different topic six and hopefully providing some new expressions.

New ways to think about life.

I dunno about that, but at least some English help for you.

It's going to get personal today, so get ready.

Yes, All right.

Are you ready to get started? Ready? Let's go.

Or our first topic is family.

And my question is, who do you think that you're the most like whom I have the most like in appearance? Yes, both you both an appearance and character.

Yeah, both.

Okay.

So appearance.

I look mostly like my mom.

I think.

Okay, I have more of her or like skin tone.

I have her eyes and on her side of the family.

Most of the people are pretty skinny.

A rather skinny guy.

My dad.

My dad's side is German and they tend to be a little bit bigger.

So yeah, I definitely got my mom's side, but character wise, I think I'm a little more like my dad.

Would you agree? Yeah, I'd say you have shades of your me so well.

So you can choose to yeah.

I think you have shades of your dad's shades.

Yeah, I think I'm more silly than my dad.

That's not very hard because my dad is pretty serious.

He's got a suicide though.

He does.

Yes, but for the most part I think I'm more like my dad because he has a very calm demeanor.

He's very patient and he doesn't get stressed about anything.

Actually, my dad gets so unstressed everything he I can't even understand it.

I'm like, How are you so calm right now? And everybody.

I know things that I'm like the most stress free person like your dad.

Even more stress free.

And.

But we're similar.

Like growing up when my parents would be going somewhere and needing to get out of the house.

Me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time and we'd be like, what will make it will be okay? No problem.

And your mom and brother and sister were saying, Come on.

Oh, my mom is much higher stress, anxious kind of person.

That's kind of a typical family situation.

How about you? I think I have both my parents in me as well.

I think I look a lot like my mom.

Yeah, you're.

She looks exactly like her mom to a.

But sometimes when I see pics years by myself.

And then I look at a picture of her at the same age.

I think, whoa, that we look really similar and she looks a lot like her mom.

So I can kind of imagine what all look like when I'm getting older.

I mean, you have darker hair and the darker features.

You got that from your now somewhat, but I think a lot of my features are similar to my mom.

But I think I also got my facial expressions from my mom.

A lot of your comments.

Wow, Vanessa, you have a lot of expression is very expressive.

I think it's true that I use a lot of expressions, but it's just natural for me.

I do this in daily life as I'm talking of out things and I think that I get that from my mom's times.

I see some of her expressions and I realize, oh, I do that too.

Yeah, I remember when we lived in South Korea, every single Korean person was commenting on Vanessa's expressions.

Like your face.

It's so exciting.

How are you making so many faces? Everybody was surprised.

I don't know in Korea they don't make as many faces.

I dunno.

Maybe it's just not.

Maybe it's just an unusual trade.

I'm grateful for that, especially as a teacher.

I can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my face as well.

But I feel like I also have parts of my dad.

My dad is a pretty rational or irrational like you're dead.

Yeah, but I think I also have his sense of humor.

Sometimes.

A little strange sense of humor, but we laugh at the same things.

We enjoy playing games and being competitive.

So I think that that side of me, maybe some of the.

The character so side of me is similar to him.

But I feel like I also have parts of my grandma.

My grandma is at go go go go person that never stops.

And I think my biggest flaw is that I have difficulty slowing down and relaxing.

I just keep going.

And I think that that's why she's with me.

Me, I need help relaxing, relax.

Yeah, So I think that my grandma's like this too.

That she's always going and always doing things and it's healthy to slow down every now and then and so I need to do that.

She probably needs to do that too sometimes, but I know if I learned that from her.

But maybe that's just part of mine.

I think it's your personality and a character.

I can remember even when I first met Vanessa and she was more go go go than she is now.

Oh, you think so? Yeah, more like for this thing to the next.

And like the enthusiasm always feels like balancing.

Always have a lot of enthusiasm.

That's truly off the charts.

Yeah, so I to know you, who are you most like in your family? Is it maybe your physical traits or your character? All right.

Let's go on to our second question.

The next topic is childhood.

I want to know when do you think childhood ends and when do you become adults? And does.

She has a deep question.

Well, I don't think it can be a specific age.

I think it's different for everyone.

I think it's at any point you can leave the house of your parents and live on your own to take care of yourself and your not like dependent on somebody else.

Like if you're living with your friends and bumming of them, you're probably not an adult yet.

So if I had to pick like an age, I probably say like sixty teams.

Oh yeah, I'm saying kind of young.

In an ideal world, I think a sixteen year old should be ready.

Okay, okay, at sixteen, were you ready? No, of course not.

Ideally, ideally.

Yeah, I don't think you know our society prepares us to be ready at sixteen.

It prepares you to be already at eighteen or later or later.

So, but you know, in an ideal world, I think you could be ready at sixteen, but it's a kind of complicated world now, so maybe eighteen is an acceptable.

I feel like for me, I have less ideas about childhood ending and adulthood starting that are physical.

I feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions.

There might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home or you have to be dependent on someone else.

But if you're making your own decisions, you are not a child.

You are in adults and I'm sure as our children get older and become teenagers, that's going to be a little bit harder for us to make that line for someone else.

But I know for myself, well that making more decisions, assuming you are capable as a person to live on your own.

Of course.

Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions, but we still need help from other people as adults so that it's a gray area.

Not so clear.

Also add, I dunno for myself personally, having children really makes you an adult.

It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but I think it's easier for some people to just kind of be really selfish and do their own thing and kind of live like a kid.

Especially nowadays because we have so much entertainment you could just watch TV every day.

A lot of guys I know play video games a lot in not knocking on video games, but playing video games every day is a good way to remain a child at heart.

Anyways, my opinion is a little judgment.

I think if you are a good person and you have a child then yours.

You feel forced to become an adult.

They're still bad people who have kids who remain children themselves and then there are bad parents.

But I think if you're generally a good person when you have kids, that's kind of a shock.

Whoa.

This child is so dependent on me.

I need to be responsible.

I have to organize myself somehow and to change being an adult.

Part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some kinds of.

Whether it's a job or your house payments or whatever it is.

So some people add those burdens of responsibility anyways with our children.

But I dunno.

For me, it's just different like this is the person I'm taking care of in my life.

People now.

Yeah, two went to coming up soon.

So I have a question for you, When do you think childhood ends? When does adulthood start? It's going to be different for every culture too.

Because this is a pretty cultural specific question.

It's different than your country.

Maybe you have a rite of passage in your country.

Can you explain what a write for a passages cause that's kind of a new one.

A rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult, like some ceremony or fifty.

Yeah, I mean, we don't really have this in the US.

As some people say, college is a rite of passage, but not, I mean more and more.

Almost everybody goes to college now.

A lot of people do.

Yeah, so it kind of is.

But it's a really bad one because usually people just go and they have parties and they live really irresponsibly.

It's not a way to become a responsible and then you do in more school.

Yeah, it's not really.

You know, becoming a man, changing your life completely.

Yeah, so I'm curious in your country, is there something that signifies now you are an adult, this kind of right of passage ceremony or festivity or
