hi i'm vanessa from speak english with vanessa dot com dan my husband who is also going to be given another perspective in today's conversation today we're bringing you an amazing long english conversation to prepare your ears prepare your mind we're going to be talking about twelve different topics and hopefully providing some new expressions new ways to think about the life i dunno about that but at least some english help for you it's going to get personal today so get ready yes all right are you ready to get started ready let's go or our first topic is family and my question is who do you think that you're the most like whom i the most like an appearance yes both both a appearance and character yeah both okay so appearance i look mostly like my mom i think okay i have more of her or like skin tone i have her eyes and on her side of the family most of the people are pretty skinny or rather skinny guy my dad my dad's side is german and they tend to be a little bit bigger so yeah i definitely got my mom's side but character wise i think i'm a little more like my dad would you agree yeah i'd say you have shades of your me so well so you can choose to yeah i think you have shades of your dad's shades yeah i think i'm more silly then my dad that's not very hard because my dad is pretty serious he's got a suicide though he does yes but from the most part i think i'm more like my dad because he has a very calm demeanor he's very patient and he doesn't get stressed about anything actually my dad gets so unstressed about everything he i can't even understand it i'm like how are you so calm right now and everybody i know things that i'm like the most stress free person like about your dad is even more stress free and but we're a similar like growing up when my parents would be going somewhere and needing to get out of the house me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time and we will be like what will make it will be okay no problem and your mom and brother and sister were saying come on girl was oh my mom is much more high stress anxious kind of person that that's kind of a typical family situation how about you i think i have both my parents in me as well i think i look a lot like my mom yeah your she looks exactly like her mom to a he sometimes when i see pictures of myself and then i look at a picture of her at the same age i think whoa that we look really similar and she looks a lot like her mom so i can kind of imagine what all look like when i'm getting older i mean you have darker hair and the darker features you got that from your deck now somewhat but i think my lot of my features are similar to my mom but i think i also got my facial expressions from my mom a lot of you comment wow vanessa you have a lot of expression is very expressive i think it's true that i use a lot of expressions but it's just natural for me i do this in daily life as i'm talking about things and i think that i get that from my mom's times i see some of her expressions and i realize oh i do that too yeah i remember when we lived in south korea every single korean person was commenting on vanessa's expressions like your face it's so exciting how are you making so many faces everybody was surprised i don't know just in korea they don't make as many faces i dunno maybe it's just not maybe it's just an unusual trade i am grateful for that especially as a teacher i can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my face as well but i feel like i also have parts of my dad my dad is a pretty rational or irrational like you're dead yeah but i think i also have his sense of humor sometimes a little strange sense of humor but we laugh at the same things we enjoy playing games and being competitive so i think that that side of me maybe some of that the character side of me a similar to him but i feel like i also have parts of my grandma my grandma is that go go go go person that's never stops and i think my biggest flaw is that i have difficulty slowing down and relaxing i just keep going and i think that that's why she's with me i need help relax relax yeah so i think that my grandma's like this to that she she's always go in and always doing things and it's healthy to slow down every now and then and so i need to do that she probably needs to do that too sometimes but i know if i learned that from her but maybe that's just part of my i think it's your personality and a character i can remember even when i first met vanessa she was more go go go then she is now oh you think so yeah more like for this thing to the next and like the enthusiasm always feels like balancing always have a lot of enthusiasm is true off the charts yeah so i wouldn't know for you who are you most like in your family is it maybe your physical traits or for your character all right let's go on to our second question the next top pick his childhood i wouldn't know when do you think childhood ends and when do you become in adults and does she has a deep question yeah well i don't think it can be a specific age i think it's different for everyone i think it's at any point you can leave the house of your parents and live on your own the take care of years self and you're not like dependent on somebody else like if you're living with your friends and bumming of them probably not an adult yet so if i had to pick like an age i'd probably say like sixteen oh yeah i'm saying kind of young an ideal world i think a sixteen year old should be ready okay okay okay at sixteen where you ready know of course now ideally ideally yeah i don't think you know our society prepares us to be ready at sixteen it prepares you to be ready at eighteen or later or later so but you know an ideal world i think you could be ready at sixty but it's a kind of complicated world now so maybe eighteen is an acceptable i feel like for me i have less ideas about childhood ending in adulthood starting that are physical i feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions there might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home or you have to be dependent on someone else but if you you're making your own decisions you are not a child you're in adults and i'm sure as our children get older and become teenagers that's going to be a little bit harder for us to make that line for someone else but i know for myself well making more decisions assuming you are capable as a person to live on your own yeah of course yeah i think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions but we still need help from other people as adults so that a gray area or clear also add i dunno for myself personally having children really makes you an adult doesn't have to be true for everyone but i think it's easier for some people to just kind of be really selfish and do their own thing and kind of live like a kid especially nowadays because we have so much entertain a mins you could just watch tv every everyday a lotta guys i know play video games a lot in not knocking on the video games but playing video games every day is a good way to remain a child at hard anyways my opinion it's a little judgment to i think if you are a good person and you have a child then your you feel forced to become an adult they're still bad people who have kids who remained children themselves and then there are that parents but i think if you're generally a good person when you have kids that's kind of a shock oh this child is so dependent on me i need to be responsible i have to organize myself somehow and to change being an adult part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some kinds of whether it's a job or your house payments or whatever it is so some people add those burdens of responsibility the anyways without children but i dunno for me it's just different to like this is the person i'm taking care of in my life people now yeah to went to coming up soon so i have a question for you when do you think childhood ends when does adulthood start it's going to be different for every culture to because this is a pretty cultural specific question it's different than your country maybe you have a rite of passage in your country can you explain what to write a passages cause that's kind of a new one thing a rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult like some ceremony or fifty yeah i mean we don't really have this in the us as some people say college is a rite of passage but not mean more and more almost everybody goes to college now a lotta people yeah so it kind of is but it's a really bad one because usually people just go and they have parties and they live really irresponsibly it's not a way to become a responsible and then you do you do more school i yeah it's not really you know becoming a man changing your life completely yeah so i'm curious in your country is there something that signifies now you are in adult this kind of rite of passage ceremony or festivity or
