hi i'm vanessa from speak english with vanessa dot com a damn day and my husband who is also going to be given another perspective in today's conversation today we're bringing new and amazing long english conversation so prepare your ears prepare your mind are going to be talking about twelve different topic six and hopefully providing some new expressions and new ways to think about life i don't know about that but at least some english help for you it's going to get personal today so get ready yes all right i you're a big i started reading let's go  our first topic is family and my question is who do you think that you're the most like whom the most like in appearance yes both you both up appearance in character that both okay so appearance i look mostly like my mom i think okay have more of her legs skin tone i have her eyes and on her side of the family most of the people are pretty skinny or rather skinny guy my dad my dad's side is german and they tend to be a little bit bigger so yeah definitely got my mom's side but character wise i think i'm a little more like my dad would you agree the yeah i'd say you have shades of your down on me so well so you can ask to i think you have shades of your dad's aids yeah i think i'm more silly than my dad that's not very hard because my dad is pretty serious he's got a suicide though he does yeah but from the most part i think i'm more like my dad because he as a very calm demeanor is very patient and he doesn't get stressed about anything and actually my dad gets so on stressed about everything he i can't even understand and i'm like how are you so calm right now and everybody i know things that i'm like the most stress free person like they and your dad is even more stress free yeah and but were similar like growing up when my parents would be going somewhere and needing to get out of the house me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time and will be like what will make it will be okay no problem and your mom and brother and sister were saying come on romantic draw lots of grow up and my mom is much more high stress anxious kind of person that's kind of a typical family situation hearing about you i think i have both the by parents and may as well i think i look a lot like my mom yeah you she looks exactly like on the road on tennessee sometimes when i see pictures of myself and then i look at a picture of her at the same age i think whoa but we look really similar and she looks thought like her mom so i can kind of imagine what all look like when i am getting older i mean you have darker hair and the darker features you get that from your deck and are somewhat by think a lot of my features are similar my mom but i think i also got my facial expressions from my mom a lot of you comment that while vanessa you have a lot of expression of is very expressive channeling that you i think it's true that i use a lot of expression but it's just natural for me i do this in daily life as i'm talking about things and i think that i get that from my mom's here hands i see some of her expressions and i realized oh i do that to of the i remember when we lived in south korea every single korean person was commenting on vanessa is expression but they're like your face it so exciting are you making so many or everybody was surprised i don't know hissing korea they don't make as many face i don't know maybe it's just not navy assistant just an unusual trade i'm grateful for that especially as a teacher i can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my face as well but i feel like i also have parts of my dad my dad is a pretty rational guy rational like your dad yeah but i think i also have his sense of humor it's sometimes a little strange sense of humor but we laugh at the same things we enjoy playing games and being competitive so i think that that side of me maybe some of that the character side of me he has similar to him but i feel like i also have parts of my grandma my grandma is a go go go go a person has two children never stops and i think my biggest flaw is that i have difficulty slowing down and relaxing i just keep going and i think that that's why she's with me i need help relax relax yeah so i think that my grandma's like this to that she's always go in and always doing things and it's healthy to slow down every now and then and so i need to do that she pioneers to do that too sometimes but i you know if i learned that from her but maybe that's just part of my i think get your personal dna like eric and i can remember even when i first met vanessa she was more go go go than she is now i think so yeah more like for this thing to the next and like the enthusiasm and all we not seriously balance i always have a lot of enthusiasm this year and a half the charsadda i want to know for you who are you most like in your family is it maybe your physical traits or for your character are let's go onto our second question the next half pick his child hired i want to know when do you think childhood ends and when you become an adult linda's just as a dm question well i don't think it can be a specific age i think it's different for everyone i think it's at any point you can leave the house of your parents and live on your own take care of your so self and you're not like dependent on somebody else like if you're living with your friends and bonding of them probably not an adult yet so if i had to pick like an age and probably say like sixteen oh yeah i'm saying kind of young and an ideal world i think a sixteen year old should be ready okay okay i go at sixteen where you ready now of course no ideally ideally yeah i don't think you know our society prepares us to be ready at sixteen it prepares you to be ready at eighteen or later right or later so but you know in an ideal world i think you could be ready at sixty it's a kind of complicated world now so maybe eighteen is unacceptable and i feel like for me i have less ideas about childhood ending and adult had starting that are physical i feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions and there might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home or you have to be dependent on someone else but if you're making your own decisions you are not a child you are in adults and i'm sure as our children get older and become teenagers that's gonna be a little bit harder for us to make that line for someone else but i know for myself well the making more decisions assuming you are capable as a person to live on your own yeah course yeah i think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions but we still need help from other people as adults so the grey area i would not so clear also add i don't know for myself personally having children really makes you and i doesn't have to be true for everyone then i think it's easier for some people to just kinda be really selfish and do their own thing and kind of live like a kid especially nowadays because we have so much entertainment you could just watch t v everyday a lot of guys i know play video games a lot not knocking on video games but playing video games every day is a good way to remain a child at hard anyways this is my opinion it's a little judgment i think if you are a good person and you have a child then you do you feel forced to become an adult they're still bad people who have kids who remain children that are sell and then they're bad parents but i think if you're generally a good person when you have kids that's kind of a shock he iwo this child is so dependent on me i need to be responsible after organize myself somehow and live and to change being an adult part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some kinds of weather a job or your house payments or whatever it is so some people add those burdens of responsibility anyways without children but i don't know for me it's just different to like this is the person i'm taking care of in my life people now i have to were to come up so and so i have a question for you when do you think childhood ends when does adulthood start it's gonna be different for every culture too because this is pretty cultural specific question may already be you who assets different than your country maybe you have a right of passage in your control can you explain what a rite of passage is because that's kind of a new on yearling a rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult i some ceremony or sarah you have any yeah i mean we don't really have this in the us some people say college is a rite of passage but not i mean more and more almost everybody goes to college know a lot of people to yeah so it kind of is but it's a really bad one because usually people does go and they have parties and they live really irresponsibly not a way to become a responsible the yeah and then you did you do more school i am not really becoming a major change in your life completely yeah so i'm curious and your country is there something that signifies now you are an adult this kind of rite of passage ceremony or festivity or
