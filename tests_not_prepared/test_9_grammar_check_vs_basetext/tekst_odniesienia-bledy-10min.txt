Hi, I was Vanessa from Speak English with Vanessa dot com.

And I Dan.

My husband, who is also go to be give another perspective in today's conversation. Today we is bringing you amazing, long, English conversation, so prepared your ear, prepare your minds. We're to be talking about twelve different topics and hopefully provide some new expressions and new ways to thinks about life. I don't have know about that, but at least some English help for you.

Yeah, It's going to get personal today, so gotten ready.

Yes, All right. Are you ready to get start?

I'm ready.

Let's gone.

Or our first topic are family, and my question is, who are you thinking that you're the most like?

Who am I the most like, in appearance?

Yes.

Both in appearance and character?

Yeah, both.

Okay, so appearance I look mostly like my mom, I thought.

Okay.

I have more of her skin tone, I has her eyes.

Yeah.

And on hers side of the family, most of the people are pretty skinny, and I rather skinny guy. My dad side is German, and they tends to be a little bit big. So yeah, I definitely have my mom's side. But character wise, I think I'm a litle more like my dad. Would you have agree?

Yeah, I'd have say you have shades of your dad.

You know me so well, so you could answer this too.

Yeah, I think you has shade of your dad.

Shades. Yeah, I think I'm more silly than my dad. That not very hard because my dad pretty serious.

He's got a silly side though.

He does. Yeah, but for the most part I think I more like my dad because he has very calm demeanor. He's very patient, and he doesn't get stressed about anything. And actually, my dad gets so unstressed about everything, I can't even understand it. I'm like, "How are you so calm right now?". And everybody I know things that I'm like the most stress free person like they know.

But your dad is even more stress free.

Yeah, but we have been similar, like growing up when my parents would be going somewhere and needing to get out of the house. Me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time. Then we would had been like, "What? Will make it. Will be okay. No problem."

And your mom, and brother, and sister were saying, "Come on, hurry".

Oh, and my mom is like "Ah, let's go". My mum is much high stress, anxious kind of personality.

That's kind of a typical family situation, I think.

Yeah, how about you?

I think I had both my parents in me as well. I think I look a lot like my mom.

Yeah, you... She look exactly like her mom to a T.

Sometimes when I saw pictures of myself, and then I look at a picture of her at the same age, I thinks, "Whoa, we look really similar". And she look a lot like her mom, so I can kind of imagine what I'll look like when I get older.

Yeah. I mean, you has darker hair and the darker features. You get that from your dad.

Yeah, somewhat. But I think a lot of my features were similar to my mom. But I think I also has got my facial expressions from my mom. A lot of you comments that, "Wow, Vanessa, you has a lot of expressions".

Your mom is very expressive, just would you.

I think it's tru that I use a lot of expressions, but it's just natural for me. I do this in daily life as I'm talking about things. And I think that I gotten that from my mom. Sometimes I saw some of her expressions and I realize, "Oh, I do that too".

Yeah, I remember when we live in South Korea, every single Korean person was comment on Vanessa's expressions. They were like, "Your face, It's so exciting. How are you making so many faces?" Everybody was surprised.

I don't know.

I guess in Korea they doesn't make as many faces.

I don't know, maybe it's just not. Maybe it's just an unusual trade. I'm grateful for that, especially as a teacher. I can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my face as well. But I feels like I also have parts of my dad. My dad is a pretty rational.

You'd rational like your dead.

Yeah, but I think I also had his sense of humor. Sometimes a little strange sense of humor, but we had laught at the same things, we enjoy playing games and being competitive. So I think that that side of me. Maybe some of the character side of me is similar to him. But I feels like I also have parts of my grandma. My grandma is a go, go, go, go person.

Oh, that's true.

She never stops, and I think my biggest flaw is that I have difficulty slowing down and relaxing. I just keep going and I think that...

That's why she with me.

I need help relaxing.

I help her relax.

Yeah, So I think that my grandma's like this too. That she always going and always doing things and it's healthy to slow down every now and then. And so, I need to do that. She probably need to do that too sometimes. But I don't know if I learned that from her, but maybe that's just part of my...

I think it your personality.

DNA, character.

Yeah, I could have remember even when I first met Vanessa, she was more go, go, go than she is now.

Oh, you think so?

Yeah, more like "so this thing, then the next, and like the enthusiasm was always, she was like bouncing.

I've always have a lot of enthusiasm, that's true.

Yes, it were off the charts.

Yeah, so I want to know for you, who are you most like in your family? Is it maybe your physical traits or for your character? All right. Let go on to our second question. The next topic is childhood. I wanted to know when do you think childhood ends and when do you becoming adults?

When does childhood end?

This is deep question.

Well, I don't think it can be a specific age. I think it's different for everyone. I think it was at any point you can left the house of your parents and live on your own. Took care of yourself and your not like dependent on somebody else. Like if you're live with your friends and bumming of them, you're probably not an adult yet. So if I have to pick like an age, I'd probably say like sixteen.

Oh

Yeah, I'm saying kind of young. In an ideal world, I think a sixteen year old should be ready.

Okay, okay, at sixteen were you ready?

No, of course not.

Ideally.

Ideally, yeah. I don't think you know our society prepares us to be ready at sixteen. It prepares you to be already at eighteen.

Or later.

Right, or later.

So, but you know, in an ideal world, I think you can be ready at sixteen, but it's a kind of complicated world now, so maybe eighteen is an acceptable age.

I feel like, for me, I have less ideas about childhood ending and adulthood start that are physical. I feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions. There may be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home, or you have to be dependent on someone else, but if you're making your own decisions, you are not a child. You are in adults. And I am being sure as our children get older and become teenagers, that's going to be a little bit harder for us to make that line for someone else. But I know for myself that making more decisions...

Well, assuming you are capable as a person to live on your own, of course.

Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions. But we still needs help from other people as adults, so there's a little gray area.

Sure, yeah.

It's not so clear.

I would also add, I don't know, for myself personally, having children really make you an adult. It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but I think it's easier for some people to just kind of be really selfish, and do their own thing, and kind of live like a kid. Especially nowadays, because we have so much entertainment you could just watch TV every day. A lot of guys I know play video games a lot, and I'm not knocking on video games, but playing video games every day is a good way to remain a child, at heart anyways.

Sure.

This is my opinion, it's a little judgmental, but...

Yeah, I think if you is a good person, and you have a child, then you feel forced to become an adult. There's still bad people who have kids, who remain children themselves and then they're bad parents. But I think if you were generally a good person, when you have kids, it's kind of a shock. Like, "Whoa, this child is so dependent on me. I need to be responsible. I have to organize myself somehow." You have to change. Being an adult, part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some kind. Whether it a job, or your house payments, or whatever it is. So, some people add those burdens of responsibility anyways without children, but I don't have known how. For me, it's just different. Like, "This is the person I'm taking care of in my life." People now.

Yeah

...because we had got two.

Well, two coming up soon. So I have a question for you, when do you think childhood ends? When does adulthood start? It's go to be different for every culture too, because this is a pretty cultural specific question. Maybe in the U.S. it should different than in your country.

Maybe you had a rite of passage in your country.

Oh, could you explain what a rite of passages is? Cause that's kind of a nuanced thing.

A rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult.

Oh, like some ceremony or activity.

Yeah, like ceremony. Yeah, I mean, we doesn't really have this in the U.S. Some people say college is a rite of passage, but not. I mean, more and more, almost everybody goes to college now.

A lot of people do.

Yeah, so it kind of is, but it does a really bad one, because usually people just go and they have parties, and they live really irresponsibly.

It's not a way to become a responsible adult.

Yeah, and then you done more school.

Yeah

It's not really, you know, become a man.

Changing your life completely. Yeah, so I'm curious in your country, is there something that signifies, "Now you is an adult." This kind of rite of passage ceremony or festivity or...
